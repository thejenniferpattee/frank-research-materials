# Frank Phase 1 Study Card

## Study Name
**Frank Phase 1: Student willingness to use an AI assisted ADHD screener**

## One Sentence Purpose
Test whether college students are willing to use Frank, and what design factors predict trust, comfort, and intent to seek help.

## Status
IRB approved. Preparing for data collection.

## Primary Research Question
Are students willing to use an AI-mediated screening and psychoeducation experience for attention-related concerns, and what predicts willingness?

## Secondary Questions
- What drives or reduces trust, perceived safety, and comfort with disclosure?
- What design elements are most likely to increase consent comprehension and reduce friction?
- What concerns students have about privacy, misuse, and harm.

## Target Population
Fort Lewis College students (adult participants).

## Recruitment Plan
Campus channels approved by IRB, such as email lists, flyers, class announcements, and student groups, with a single survey link.

## Study Design
Cross-sectional survey with a short standardized product concept exposure. Participants review a brief description of Frank plus sample screens or a short demo, then complete measures.

## Inclusion Criteria
18+, Current student.

## Exclusion Criteria
Under 18, Anyone who does not provide consent.

## Procedure
- Participants open the link.
- Read a plain language consent page.
- View the Frank concept and example flow.
- Complete measures about willingness, trust, perceived safety, and concerns.
- Receive debrief and support resources.

## Primary Outcomes
- Willingness to try Frank.
- Acceptability of Frank.
- Trust and perceived safety.
- Intent to seek help or learn more after using a tool like this.

## Key Measures
- **Willingness and likelihood to use**: Custom items such as likelihood to try, likelihood to recommend, likelihood to use if struggling, likelihood to use if a friend asked.
- **Acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility**: Use brief implementation outcomes measures if you are using them, or parallel custom items if you are not.
- **Trust and comfort with disclosure**: Perceived safety, perceived benefit, perceived risk, and comfort answering sensitive questions.
- **Privacy and governance concerns**: Fear of data misuse, who might access data, retention concerns, and clarity of consent.

## Suggested Hypotheses
- **H1**: Students will show moderate to high willingness to try an AI-assisted screener when the tool is framed as educational and non-diagnostic.
- **H2**: Clear privacy posture and clear boundaries will predict higher trust and higher willingness.
- **H3**: Perceived stigma and fear of data misuse will predict lower willingness and lower comfort with disclosure.
- **H4**: Students with prior frustration accessing assessment will show higher willingness than those without that experience.

## Planned Analysis
- Descriptive statistics for willingness, acceptability, trust, and concerns.
- Scale reliability checks if you are using multi-item composites.
- Correlations between willingness and trust, perceived benefit, perceived risk, and privacy concerns.
- Group comparisons if collected and powered, such as prior ADHD diagnosis, prior assessment experience, or year in school.
- Qualitative coding of open-ended responses into themes that inform redesign priorities.

## Ethics and Risk Management
- Non-clinical framing. No diagnosis. No treatment advice.
- Minimize sensitive data collection. Ask only what is needed to answer the research questions.
- Provide support resources and a debrief that normalizes help-seeking.
- Explicitly state confidentiality limits and data handling in plain language.

## Data Handling
- No identifiers unless required for incentives, and if collected, store separately from responses.
- Store only de-identified survey data.
- No raw text that could identify a person in the public repo.
- Publish only synthetic examples, schemas, and aggregated results.

## Deliverables
- Phase 1 protocol and consent packet.
- Measures registry entry with provenance and scoring.
- Summary poster in preparation.
- Short paper or report in preparation.

## Limitations You Will State Up Front
- Intent to use is not the same as real-world use.
- Single campus sample may not generalize.
- Self-report measures and concept exposure can inflate positivity.
- Results inform design direction and ethics constraints, not clinical validity.

## Fast Next Steps Checklist
- Finalize the concept stimulus and screenshots.
- Finalize measures and the measures registry.
- Run a quick pilot with a tiny convenience sample to catch confusion in consent and wording.
- Launch recruitment.
