# Consent Form for Participation

## About the Study
Thank you for agreeing to participate in this research study about how college students feel about using digital tools to help evaluate patterns in their attention, focus, and mood.
The purpose of this study is to better understand how students perceive digital or AI-assisted tools of this kind. What we learn will help refine the wording, design, and ethical approach of an AI-assisted screening tool for future testing.
This study does not diagnose any condition and does not test a medical device.

The survey should take only a few minutes to complete. You may skip any question or leave it blank if you prefer not to answer.
There are no direct benefits to participating, and no foreseeable risks.
